  <p> This is my poster for class.</p>
  <p> I chose this specific topic because many families are being split up by the Government because of the immigration laws.
      Imagine a family where the dad isn't a United States Citizen and has to be deported because of that, it isn't fair and
      the immagration laws should be a lot more flexible.
