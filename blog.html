    <h3> My name is Shakim Matthew, I'm 20 years old and I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Growing up, I always thought life would be simple and fun because of the environment I was raised in. Once I did what I had to do like in school and around the house, my parents would always be very proud. I really enjoyed my childhood and wish it stayed forever, but life goes on and I had to move on. Now that I'm matured, life has gotten a lot harder but I love it. I feel like being an adult means having a whole lot of responsibilities. I have been graphic designing and video editing ever since I was like 12 years old. In the future, I see myself working at Disney or any high end company for graphic designing or video editing. I'm also into fashion a lot so if I could make a clothing line or model for a clothing line that would be great too. As much as I love NYC, I don't see myself living here for the rest of my life, I want to get the most I can from here then move on. “You'll never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.” - John C. Maxwell. </h3></div>
